# minimum_wage_revisited
http://originaldatum.com/?p=144

This week I revisited the data I had on minimum wage. I wanted to explore the relationship between minimum wage and poverty. 
I had taken a geographic spin on it last time around, focusing on where inequality was in the country and where state minimum wage 
had differed from the federal wage. This time, I hoped to target that relationship more directly, without the lens of geography.

As all economic questions go, it is hard to completely isolate the variables from time, especially with the idea of leading or 
lagging indicators. Rather than have time as one of my main axes, I used the animation to show the relationship between the two variables
over time (starting in 1980). On the data side of things, in order to remove distortion due to the effects of inflation over the time 
period, I indexed the historical nominal minimum wage to 2014 dollars. 

The files included here are what I used in the process. 

 - The data (stored in the csv and xls files) can be found at the following links:
      http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/stateminwagehis.htm
      http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpid1501.pdf table 27 
 - The R file is what I used to combine the two data sets, and calculate the real minimum wage.
 - The html file contains the Javascript/HTML/CSS/D3 for the visualization.
